For each question in your assessment, add a corresponding category in questionRecommendations. 3. Ensure primaryCategory is set to your main scoring category. 4. Use the question's category name exactly as it appears in the questions section. 5. Each question should contribute to both its own category score and the primaryCategory score. 6. The paths in nextRoute should include the assessment ID (e.g., '/survey/your-assessment-id'). 7. Use Title Case for category names (e.g., 'Stress Management', not 'stress_management' or 'stress-management'). 8. Make sure the same category name format is used consistently in the 'category' field, scores object, and questionRecommendations section. 9. Remove this _setup_instructions field when done.",
