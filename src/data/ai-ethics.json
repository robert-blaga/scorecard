Teams are unaware of or disregard industry regulations, exposing the organization to legal penalties. Data handling practices frequently violate privacy standards, creating vulnerability to breaches. There is no structured forum for discussing ethics, leading to siloed and ad‑hoc practices. Training is non‑existent or purely theoretical, with no simulation or practical application. This environment creates systemic risk and undermines organizational integrity.",
