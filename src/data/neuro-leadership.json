                "intro": "Employees frequently struggle to connect neuroscience concepts with leadership challenges. Cognitive biases and emotional triggers often go unrecognized, leading to suboptimal outcomes.",
                "main_text": "Decision‑making is hindered by unmanaged stress and visibility of cognitive load. Emotional regulation techniques are absent or rarely used, causing reactive leadership behaviors. Teams communicate without leveraging brain‑based clarity strategies, resulting in misunderstandings. Reward and motivation frameworks are not intentionally designed, leading to varying engagement levels. Overall, the lack of neuroscience‑informed practices has tangible impacts on performance and culture.",
